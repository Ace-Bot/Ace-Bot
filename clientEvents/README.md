You probably have a lot of questions why every single event
for `Discord.js` and `Discord.js-Command` is in here. Here
are a few reasons why I did this:

- For logging how many of each event happens for guilds, channels, users, and global.
- Since AceBot is meant for showing information, I can show how many events happen.
